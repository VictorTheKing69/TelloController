# Tello Controller
An example Tello project for Scratch3-Tello

## How to setup
### 1. Installing Scratch3-Tello
#### Scratch3-Tello is an extension to Scratch Desktop that allows you to code Tello using Scratch 3.0. DJI, the developer of Tello, also provides an extension to fly Tello using Scratch, but it doesnâ€™t support Scratch 3.0, so I created this extension. It is free to use.
